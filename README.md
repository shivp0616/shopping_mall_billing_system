This is just a simple c++ program on Shopping mall Billing.
Shopping mall is the place where customers come to purchase their daily using products and pay for that. So there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to generate the bill for the customer. In our project we have 3 users. First is the data entry operator who will enter the products in database. Second one is the administrator who will decide the taxes and commissions on the products and can see the report of any product. Third one is the bill calculating operator who will calculate the bill and print.
